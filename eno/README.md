ENO
====

External Network Operator (ENO) enables network automation and orchestration for Kubernetes clusters.

ENO puts a framework in place which is responsible for the network orchestration
inside the cluster as well as in the fabric level. ENO is designed to provide support
for a large number of CNIs for automation of network creation inside the cluster and
due to its modular southbound plugin system enables the incorporation and development of
an arbitrary number of fabric plugins for the configuration of different fabrics.
