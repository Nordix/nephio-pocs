Cloud Native Configurations for Kubernetes.

Make your Kubernetes applications more cloud native by injecting runtime cluster
information into your ConfigMaps.

It allows for network functions that are not designed to be cloud native
(do not self-configure or self-orchestrature) to work better in a cloud native
environment by handling dependency discovery and configuration.
